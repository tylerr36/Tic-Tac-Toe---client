# Tic - Tac - Toe



A single player game that allows the user to create an account and play tic tac toe
against a second player on the same machine. Game statitistics and accounts
are tracked through an API that allows the game engine to display results unique
to each account.

# Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- AJAX

# Development & Problem Solving Process

- For the layout, a wire frame was created for the overall basis of how the front
end of the page would look.

- User stories were then created to get a sense of the logic that would be
implemented for the game engine and api.

- During creation, game logic was created first. Then the API was added for the
information and game statistics.

- Lastly, once all of the functions were done CSS styles were implemented for
a visually appealing experience.
